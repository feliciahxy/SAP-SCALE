## Key Workflows

### Flight to Maintenance Workflow
1. System detects grounded aircraft due to maintenance issues
2. Operator clicks "Schedule Maintenance" button
3. Maintenance is automatically scheduled with resource allocation
4. Timeline updates in real-time showing the new maintenance slot
5. Flight status updates across all connected systems

### Capacity Management Workflow
1. Analytics detect route capacity constraints
2. System alerts operators to potential revenue loss
3. Operator reviews demand forecast and adds flights
4. New flights are created with automated gate and crew assignment
5. Revenue impact is calculated and displayed

## Business Value

- **30% reduction** in IT operational costs through cloud consolidation
- **25% decrease** in unplanned maintenance through predictive analytics
- **$2.4M+ revenue capture** through dynamic capacity management
- **40% improvement** in maintenance workflow efficiency
- **Real-time insights** enabling faster operational decisions

## Compliance & Security

- IATA standards compliance for airline operations
- FAA/EASA regulatory requirements built-in
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Role-based access control through SAP BTP
- Comprehensive audit trails for all transactions

## Future Enhancements
